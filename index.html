                <h3>Why InJanus?</h3>
                <p>
                    In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus, pronounced [ˈjaː.nus] 
                    is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, 
                    passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, 
                    since he looks to the future and to the past. It is conventionally 
                    thought that the month of January is named for Janus (Ianuarius), 
                    but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs Juno was the tutelary 
                    deity of the month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Janus presided over the beginning and ending of conflict, 
                    and hence war and peace. The gates of a building in Rome 
                    named after him (not a temple, as it is often called, but 
                    an open enclosure with gates at each end) were opened in time of 
                    war, and closed to mark the arrival of peace 
                    (which did not happen very often). As a god of transitions, he 
                    had functions pertaining to birth and to journeys and exchange, and 
                    in his association with Portunus, a similar harbor and gateway 
                    god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, InJanus - The god of the here and now</p>
