I am a 3rd year computer engineering student at the university of cincinnati with experience in web development, server side hosting, AWS, and various coding languages. I am currently interested in pursuing a carrerr in the embedded systems field working on both hardware and software. I have done tons of personal projects including making websites, hosting websites, command line ascii art applications, python API's, and microcontroller applications.
Some things on co-op that I have accopolished is Development of a web app tool called Solution Link at Siemens Software. Solution Link is a marketing tool used by the sales staff to sell our products more easily. Inside of Solution link I worked on Mindstart witch is a search tool using elasticsearch and python that has the capabilites to serach all of the projects and products and services that Siemens has.
On my first coop with Siemens, I primarly worked on getting up to speed on the project as well as getting the AWS eviroment working. my job was to fix an issue about cold starts witch is starting while the containers havent loaded causing slower load times. My solution was to load them every so often so that the issue is fixed. I then worked on bugs and testing to fix bugs and to report them as well.
My second coop, also with Siemens, I continued work with bug fixing but I was also put in charge of getting new implemtations done as user stories. This is benifital becuase this allows me to get experience with the process.
