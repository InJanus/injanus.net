Hi!  I am a 3rd-year, computer engineering student at the University of Cincinnati with experience in web development, server-side hosting, AWS, and various coding languages. I am interested in pursuing a career in the embedded systems field, working on both hardware and software. I enjoy working on many personal projects, including making and hosting websites, command line ASCII art applications, python APIs, and microcontroller applications.
Currently, I am looking for a co-op for the Spring and Summer of 2021. My primary interest is working on an electrical co-op in Cincinnati or really anywhere in the country. I am passionate about my work and enjoy learning, helping, and solving difficult problems.
1) Development of a web app tool called Solution Link at Siemens Software. Solution Link is a marketing tool used by the sales staff to sell our products more easily. Inside of Solution link, I worked on Mindstart which is a search tool that uses elastic search and python that can search all of the projects and products and services that Siemens has.
2) On my first co-op with Siemens, I primarily worked on getting the AWS environment working. I fixed an issue with cold starts - containers taking too long to load because they had turned off.  My solution was to automatically load them every so often so that they never had time to get cold, which fixed the issue. I then worked on finding, fixing and testing bugs in the program.
3) My second co-op, also with Siemens, I continued working on bug fixing and was also put in charge of completing new user story implementations. This was my first experience with the new development process.
