I am a 3rd-year computer engineering student at the University of Cincinnati with experience in web development, server-side hosting, AWS, and various coding languages. I am currently interested in pursuing a career in the embedded systems field working on both hardware and software. I have done tons of personal projects including making websites, hosting websites, command line ASCII art applications, python APIs, and microcontroller applications.
I am looking for a Coop for the Spring of 2021 and the Summer of 2021. I am primarily interested in electrical coops in Cincinnati but I am also looking to go anywhere in the country. I am passionate about my work and about what I can do to better help and solve problems.
Some things on co-op that I have accomplished is Development of a web app tool called Solution Link at Siemens Software. Solution Link is a marketing tool used by the sales staff to sell our products more easily. Inside of Solution link, I worked on Mindstart which is a search tool using elastic search and python that can search all of the projects and products and services that Siemens has.
On my first coop with Siemens, I primarily worked on getting up to speed on the project as well as getting the AWS environment working. my job was to fix an issue about cold starts witch is starting while the containers haven't loaded causing slower load times. My solution was to load them every so often so that the issue is fixed. I then worked on bugs and testing to fix bugs and to report them as well.
My second coop, also with Siemens, I continued work with bug fixing but I was also put in charge of getting new implementations done as user stories. This is beneficial because this allows me to get experience with the process.
